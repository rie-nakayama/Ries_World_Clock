# Rie's World Clock

## Overview
Rie's World Clock is a Python-based graphical application that displays the current time for multiple locations of my friends and family worldwide. It uses the Tkinter library for the GUI, `pytz` for timezone handling, and PIL for displaying country flags.

## Time Zones & Flags
The application displays time for the following locations:
- **Istanbul, Turkey** (KCHAN) ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡·
- **Pacific Time, USA** (CHERISHIE) ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
- **Dublin, Ireland** (SHARON) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡ª
- **Sydney, Australia** (DAN) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º
- **Tokyo, Japan** (ME!) ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ
- **Bangkok, Thailand** (DAY) ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­

Each location includes a label for the person's name, a digital clock, and a flag.
